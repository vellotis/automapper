Automapper supports processing asynchronous mappings. Instead of calling `Mapper::map` it is required to call `Mapper::mapAsync`.

:::caution

If a mapping configuration includes asynchronous operations, but the mapping is executed by calling `Mapping::map`
instead of `Mapping::mapAsync`, it will result with an error which requests the use of `Mapping::mapAsync`.

:::

An example below will give a slight overview of asynchronous mapping.

```ts
import { createMap, forMember, mapFrom } from '@automapper/core';

createMap(
    mapper,
    User,
    UserDto,
    //                  ðŸ‘‡ We are fetching the "fullName" manually
    //                  ðŸ‘‡          ðŸ‘‡ so we need to define its retrieval operation
    forMember((d) => d.fullName, mapFrom(async (source) => {
        return await fetchFullName(source);
    }
);

//                          ðŸ‘‡ mapAsync is needed if any async operations are configured for the mapping profile
const dto = await mapper.mapAsync(user, User, UserDto);
```

## Support

The support for asynchronous processing among member mapping functions are listed in [NamingConvention](../fundamentals/mapping#mappingtransformation).

The asynchronous processing is supported also by
  - [`afterMap`](./after-map) and [`beforeMap`](./before-map) mapping hooks, and
  - `destinationConstructor`, `postMap` and `preMap` options in mapping strategy.
